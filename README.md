# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

Welcome to the "Machine Learning Models from Scratch" repository! In this repository, I aim to implement various machine learning models entirely from scratch using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, I believe that building models from scratch provides a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and enhances programming skills.

The repository includes implementations of various machine learning models, including but not limited to:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine's
